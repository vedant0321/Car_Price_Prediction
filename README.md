**Car Price Prediction Model using Python**

The dataset I’m using here to train a car price prediction model was downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about all the main features that contribute to the price of a car. So let’s start this task by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:

**Python Libraries used :**
* Numpy
* Panda
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn


**Applied**
* Plotgraph
* Heatmap

**Training a Car Price Prediction Model**

I will use the decision tree regression algorithm to train a car price prediction model. So let’s split the data into training and test sets and use the decision tree regression algorithm to train the model:

**Technologies Used :** 
* Python  
* Machine Learning

**IDE -** Google Collab
